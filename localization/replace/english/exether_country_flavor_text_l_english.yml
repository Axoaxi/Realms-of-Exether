  DUM_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Empire of Dumonia is a land of ancient traditions and fading glory, once the center of human power before the rise of magic brought it crashing down. The Nightfall led to the collapse of most of the empire, and today only the heartlands on Noricum remain under imperial control. It must grapple with a host of internal problems lest it be reduced to an even more humiliating state. Internal divides and external enemies, the Empire will have to tackle and resolve those issues before it can even consider looking West to restore its former glory."
  JUR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Inquisitor calls upon the flame of the mighty, holy Kamiros, god of light. He calls unto the bright judge to vanquish all whom sin heinously under the cover of night. This land has incurred the punishment of the nightbane, and Jurian answers the call. With fanatic fervor, he has established a foothold for the inquisition to carry out retribution and return these green pastures to the righteous. This expedition will prove his faith and spread the truth of Kamiros to the ignorant. May the night horrors fear, for the sunkissed have arrived."
  YAN_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Yanger Nomads are a people hailing from the the vast steppes of the western reaches of Noricum. Historically, these lands were a former imperial province of Dumonia, the land ripe for wealthy Dumonian ranchers.  However, it was not the wealthy Dumonian landowner who would come to rule the steppe; but the horselords of the Yanger and their riders.  Now, Dumonia has retreated to its' heartland, and these steppes lay in control of men hardened by war. With much talk of magic and the return of the gods, people look for an answer. In the eternal skies of the steppes exists a chaotic storm, serving as a prophecy for the many religious of forthcoming change. The steppe-riders lie prepared to weather the storm once more."
  AUM_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Order of the Sun is a dominion within the Dumonian Empire. It is a small, although powerful, semi-independent theocratic state that serves as the centre of the faith for the Cult of the Sun. The state is said to be guided directly by Holy Kamiros, Lord of Light, with the high priest merely acting as their interpreter. The Bright Judge works to uphold this righteous land as a haven for all believers by driving away darkness and spreading his divine nature through his holy word. This sacred land is a beacon for all who seek Kamiros and his teachings."
  CER_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Arrador's victory against the Dumonian Empire during the Viceroy's War divorced Ceraun from the Empire against its own will. Hostile to its new neighbors and dependent on Dumonia, Ceraun has sold out its industry to imperial aristocrats. Will Ceraun continue its existince as a buffer state for foreign powers or can a new Cerunite state emerge beneath the shadow of the Empire?"
  BDB_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Buramog Wars, a series of conflicts opposing Ceraun to the Buramog Orcish clans, have left the Orcish lands blighted as the Cerunite's Wyldfire Tincture, a powerful chemical agent, have withered the once-lush fields and forests. Surviving in the now-called Plaguewood, can the martial traditions of the Buramogs keep protecting the Orcs against Human and Elvish aggression?"

  SMA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Halfling Principality of Smallshore-Gladcross, placed on the coast between Arrador and Ceraun, enjoys a positive relationship with its powerful neighbors as an important exporter of goods. This balance is however increasingly fragile as the two powers desire to expand their market south of the Principality, in the resource-full Moorweald and Whiskerfields. Will Smallshore-Gladcross manage to protect its independence while many citizens call the monarchy to safeguard the oppressed Halfling minority in Ceraun?"

  WHI_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Largely untouched by outside influence, Whiskerfields exists as an idyllic agricultural dreamland on the surface. However despite external appearances the Mousefolk suffer a rising issue as a result of their pleasant homeland; there's too many of them! Mousefolk have barely ever migrated out of their homeland over the centuries and the recent Nightfall disaster further encouraged such and has cultivated a sense of 'Armed Pacificism' nationally against encroaching political elements. Yet times are changing at an ever increasing pace. The advent of the Railroad in neighboring Ceraun and the Astral Consortium may yet serve as a catalyst for the masses of Whiskerfield who currently find themselves packed together more and more in their homeland...like rats."
  DAR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The conclusion of the Nightfall saw the Dwarves of Mount Yelfis awaken from their self-entombment surrounded on all sides by unfamiliar faces and even more unfamiliar technology. Utterly encircled the Dwarves were swift to interact with their industrious neighbors and learn of these new innovations. Decades later this early necessity of curiosity has paid off handily as Darvak now stands as a giant of industry in the region. However, it now stands at the precipice of yet another massive societal shift as leaders across Yelfie society compete for dominance in order to be the one to carve out Darvak's path as an regional powerhouse...or perhaps something even greater?"
  EMP_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Similar to Arrador, Emparal was a rich prospering province during the height of the Dumonian Empire. Similar to Arrador, Emparal fought for its independence from the Empire during the Chaos of the Nightfall. Whilst Arrador did most of the heavy lifting in this conflict Emparal made its contributions to the effort. Today Emparal continues to prosper as one of the richest nations along Settler's Coast. Will it settle for remaining in its 'Big Brother's' shadow to the North or will it carve out an Empire to the South? It faces a slew of issues to confront first...namely the Orcs to their Southern frontier and keeping a close eye on the developing political situation of the Dwarven Hold to its North... One wrong move could potentially undo decades of prosperity for the enlightened Bossardi state."
  KRC_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The province of Mistreach during the times of the Dumonian Empire was a vital crossroads between Arrador and Emparal. The flow of goods helped solidify Mistreach's identity and when the Nightfall arrived; it too chose to throw in with the other rebelling provinces lest it be annexed. Despite this choice however Mistreach now sits as a co-state of Emparal as the Principality of Kracia. Ruled by its King and with limited autonomy it remains unlikely that Mistreach will ever manage to exist as an independent state. Yet still perhaps opporunity may yet be found across Lake Bossard or at the peaks of Mount Yelfis! Settler's Coast may have been relatively quiet in recent times but change is on the horizon. Will Mistreach succeed in riding this tide or be drowned beneath it?"
  PRI_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Dumonian province of Prilyra was the breadbasket of Settler's Coast and had remained loyal to the Empire when the Nightfall happened. The sleepy rural communities saw little reason in marching from their homes for so-called 'Independence' Sadly for them, they chose the losing side of that war. Swarmed over by the Rebelling provinces and promptly forced into the new political order that followed Dumonia's defeat. Decades have passed since and little has changed for the Wealder people of Prilyra. They are a simple farming society and above all simply wish to be left alone. The world can change as much as it pleases, for Prilyrans? As long as harvests are good, life is good and they will fight to guarantee that if needed."

 GENERIC_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Magic and gods are new and world-changing concepts to the people of Exether. In some places, it has given rise to new religions or a return to ancient traditions, but in others, it has inspired intense scientific study. What new challenges will this new and rapidly changing world bring?"
